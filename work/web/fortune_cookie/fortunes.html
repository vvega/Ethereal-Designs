	<p>$$You will get some new clothes.|
    Watch out for puddles.|
    I'm right behind you.|
    You will sneeze today.|
    Be wary of your creepy roommate.|
    Someone is out to get you.|
    Watch out for speeding cars.|
    Don't get on that plane.|
    You may want to stock up on food, water, and ammunition.|
    You will have a cat.|
    Don't ride the subway tomorrow.|
    The package delivered tomorrow will be a bomb.|
    Next week you will win $1,000,000 worth of gum.|
    The lottery number is 1337.|
    You will get some new shoes.$$</p>
