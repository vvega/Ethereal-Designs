                    <h3>Science Information on the Web</h3>    
                     <p>
                        There are a number of useful websites that you may use to keep yourself up to
                        date on developments in Biology. You should take the time to periodically check on a
                        few of them. For one reason, this is an area of your own interest. You will usually find a
                        story that interests you or helps you with a topic in one of your classes. For another
                        reason, schools/programs that you will be applying to in the future often expect this and
                        you may have some related questions in your interviews. I will list three sites for you:</p>
                        <p class = "list">
                        1) <a href = "http://www.sciencedaily.com/">http://www.sciencedaily.com/</a>. <br/>This is a very good site. It updates with a new story
                        every few hours on weekdays. It is slower on weekends but still, in my opinion, the
                        best of the three.</p>

                        This site usually	
                       updates once a day (around 4:00 pm) on weekdays and not on weekends.

                  <!--  <div id = "r_img">
                    </div>-->
                    <p>The Wildlife Care Department of the Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife
                    State Park offers internships to students who are currently enrolled in biologyrelated
                    undergraduate and graduate programs at accredited colleges and
                    universities. Although most of our interns work here during the summer, our
                    program is open all year to qualifying applicants.</p>
                    <p>Benefits<br />
                    No pay is earned during the internship experience in our Department, and
                    transportation, room, and board are the responsibility of the intern. However, we
                    have two bedrooms inside our Felburn Wildlife Care Center that are available on
                    a first-come, first served basis to successfully placed interns. The bedrooms share
                    a full bath, and a kitchenette with microwave oven and refrigerator are available
                    24-hours a day to interns living in the Center.</p>
                    <p>Time Commitment<br />
                    Although the position of intern is a specialized volunteer placement, for the
                    internship to be validated, we require a time commitment of 30 hours per week
                    for at least 6 weeks. Additional hours can be accommodated, up to a 40-hour
                    work week. The weekly schedule will vary depending on the duties assigned.<br />
                    Summer Session: May-August<br />
                    Fall Session: September-December<br />
                    Spring Session: January-April</p>
                    <p>Duties<br/>
                    Your service at the Park will include care of wildlife and their enclosures,
                    maintenance and housekeeping inside the Center, and presentation of educational
                    programs. Interns work with ALL of the Park's wildlife; there are no positions
                    available to work exclusively with manatees.
                    You may pursue a specific research project along with your duties. Your proposal
                    must be submitted in writing for approval by the Wildlife Care Supervisor. This
                    proposal must include an introduction describing your goals and objectives,
                    materials and methods, and an estimate of the amount of time required to
                    complete the project.</p>
                    <p>
                    What follows is a basic outline of the job responsibilities of an intern at the Ellie
                    Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park. They are based on the job
                    description of a Wildlife Care Ranger; however, some requirements have been
                    eliminated to realistically accommodate the abilities of a temporary intern. Your
                    specific job description may be altered depending on the instructions of the
                    Wildlife Care Supervisor.</p>
                    <p class = "big_list">VISITOR SERVICE<br/>

                    <p class = "big_list">RESOURCE MANAGEMENT<br/>
                    Follows instructions and implements wildlife management plans. Intern will be
                    expected to read and research existing park literature to fully understand the
                    state's philosophy on ecosystem management.</p>
                    <p class = "big_list">MAINTENANCE<br/>
                    Intern may be asked to help maintain and repair buildings, fences, trails, service
                    roads, boardwalks, docks and other facilities. You will be expected to maintain
                    cleanliness of grounds and facilities.</p>
                    <p class = "big_list">ADMINISTRATION<br />
                    Intern is expected to keep accurate records relating to wildlife care.
                    Understanding state required forms on a wide range of subjects will be necessary.</p>
                    <p class = "big_list">PROTECTION<br/>
                    Intern must ensure park rules are followed for the enjoyment of the visitor.</p>
                    <p>Attire<br/>
                    We are a uniformed service. Interns wear a gray volunteer T-shirt provided by the
                    Park. When presenting educational programs, you are required to wear a plain
                    white or grey shirt with collar and buttons down the front, which is not provided
                    by the Park. The Park will issue a nametag for the shirt. You must wear black
                    shorts or slacks with the white shirt or the T-shirt. Black socks and black shoes
                    (athletic shoes are acceptable) must be worn with slacks, and white accessories
                    must be worn with the shorts.</p>
                    <p>Process<br/>
                    Interns will be interviewed and placed by the Wildlife Care Supervisor, Susan
                    Lowe. Additional training will be provided on-the-job and through workshops.<br/>
