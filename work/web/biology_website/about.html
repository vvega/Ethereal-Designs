                        <p>It is the mission of the Department of Biology to provide a high quality education
                        in Biology that is rich in numerous educational and practical experiences for our students.
                        This education is well designed to prepare the students for their future endeavors. These
                        endeavors include: success in professional health school (such as medical, dental,
                        veterinarian, etc.), success in graduate school (either Masters or Doctoral), or success in a
                        career in the biological sciences. The department provides programs in:</p>

             <p>Welcome to the University of Central Florida and to the Department of Biology.
            This is an exciting time with many challenges and opportunities awaiting you. We hope
            that you make the most of your experience here. The Department of Biology wishes to
            help you towards that end. Please take the time during your first few weeks at UCF to
            stop by the Biology Office (Biology Building room 301). At the Biology Office you can
            request to have a Biology faculty member assigned to you as your advisor. Although you
            have many excellent sources of advising available to you, you should also make use of an
            advisor in your major. Only someone in Biology knows the best balance of courses to
            take and which courses to take towards achieving your goals with a B.S. in Biology.
            Whether your goals are to attend professional school (e.g. medicine, veterinary, dental,
            etc.), attend graduate school, or to immediately enter the workforce we wish to help you.
            Please feel free to contact the department with your questions and concerns.
            Good luck with your first semester at UCF. We hope that it is a productive and
            rewarding experience for you.</p>

            	<h3>A letter from the Program Coordinator...</h3>
                <p>
                    Hello, <br />
                    This is the first in what I plan to be a number of regularly occurring emailnewsletters.
                    I intend for these newsletters to be monthly. They will contain
                    announcements, job and research postings, scholarship and financial aid opportunities,
                    and other information that should help you over the course of the semester.
                    First of all, I wish to welcome you back to UCF, or to UCF for the first time, for
                    the Fall 2010 semester. I hope that you had a nice break and are ready to meet the
                    challenges ahead. We have a number of interesting classes for you this term including
                    some rarely offered classes (ex; Animal Behavior). This should be a good semester and I
                    wish you well in it.
                </p>
