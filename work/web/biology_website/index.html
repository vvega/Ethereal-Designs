                 <p>This is an exciting time with many challenges and opportunities awaiting you. We hope

                help you towards that end. Please take the time during your first few weeks at UCF to
                stop by the Biology Office (Biology Building room 301). At the Biology Office you can
                request to have a Biology faculty member assigned to you as your advisor. <em><a href = "about.html">Read more...</a></em></p>

                  <h3>Biology Exit Exam</h3>
                	<p>
                    Students planning on graduating in Fall 2009 must take the Comprehensive Exit
                    Exam this semester. The exam will be held on Friday November 5th at 2:00 PM in BL
                    304 and on Saturday, November 6th at 11:30 AM in BL 304.</p>
                    <p class = "list">
                    (a) You must sign up for the Comprehensive Exit Exam at the Biology Office
                    (BL301) by September 17th to be eligible to take the exam. Students must take the
                    Comprehensive Exit Exam and earn a passing score to graduate.</p>
                    <p class = "list">
                    (b) Unlike past years, students must pay to take the Biology Exit Exam. Students
                    must pay the UCF Bookstore for their exam. The payment period will be between
                    September 20 and October 1.</p>
                    <p>
                    Please note that since the student is now required to pay for the test we have much
                    less flexibility than we have had in the past. If you miss these deadlines you will be
                    forced to delay your graduation until the spring.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Registering for Spring 2011</h3>
                    <p>
                    The registration period for most students for Spring 2011 will be in October. You
                    should plan on meeting with your Biology Advisor in late September so that you have
                    everything planned out when your registration window opens. If you do not know whom
                    your advisor is, please contact the Biology Office (BL 301, 407-823-2141). Remember:
                    it is always important to consult with your major advisor when planning out classes.

                    <h3>Knights Email</h3>
                    <p>
                    All undergraduate students are required to use their UCF Knights Email account.
                    This account is the email address listed on all class rosters and is the one that faculty will
                    be using to communicate with students. You need to check your Knights Email account
                    regularly to keep informed about class and UCF announcements.
