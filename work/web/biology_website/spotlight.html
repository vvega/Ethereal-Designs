                         <h3>Seminars</h3>
                        Seminars are a weekly departmental event where current topics in biology are
                        discussed. UCF faculty and visiting faculty present a paper at the seminar and answer
                        questions. It is a good way to learn some information about your field (s) of interest in
                        biology. Seminar is a graduate level class. However, it is open to interested
                        undergraduate students (as long as seating allows). The topic and speaker are posted
                        throughout the Biology Building prior to the event. Seminars are held in BL 209 on
                        Mondays at 3:00.

               <p> The Department of Biology is fortunate to have many excellent faculty dedicated
                to teaching our undergraduate students. In the future I intend to profile one faculty
                member per newsletter. For this first newsletter, and since a number of you are new to
                UCF, I am will simply direct you to the UCF Biology Faculty and Instructor webpages.
                For professors go to:</p><p class = "list"> <a href = "http://biology.cos.ucf.edu/faculty_index.php">http://biology.cos.ucf.edu/faculty_index.php</a></p><p> and for instructors go to:</p>

                (a) Unfortunately this summer one of our faculty, Dr. Kevin Woo, chose to leave
                UCF. In the short time that he was with us, he became an important member of
                our department and he will be missed.

                <p class = "list">
                (b) We have been fortunate to add two new faculty members. They are Dr. Gregg
                Klowden and Dr. Mary Beth Manjerovic. Many of you will have one or both of
                them in your classes. Dr. Klowden is team teaching Biology 2 and Ecology. Dr.
                Manjerovic is teaching a section of Biology 1 and Animal Behavior. Some of you
                may already know Dr. Manjerovic. She was a graduate student in our department
                who received her Ph.D. this summer.</p>

                   <h2>Prehealth Professional Students</h2>
                    <h3>Can I Go To Medical School With a Degree in Biology?<br/>
                    Yes!</h3>
                     <div id = "s_undergrad_img">
                    </div>
                    <p>Prehealth Professional students (often referred to as "preprofessional
                    students") are students who are preparing to enter into a health professional program after
                    graduating from UCF. There are a variety of professional health programs that these
                    students plan to attend, and to matriculate from, so as to succeed in their dreams of
                    serving in the professional health field. These programs include: Allopathic Medicine,
                    Chiropractic Medicine, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine, Optometry, Osteopathic
                    Medicine, Pharmacy, Physician Assistant, and Podiatric Medicine.</p>
                    <p>There are many pathways that a prehealth professional student may take to succeed
                    at UCF. Regardless of what some believe, there is no one major that ensures a student's
                    success at this endeavor. In fact any major with the appropriate courses may allow a
                    student to achieve his/her goal. However, due to academic strength, science majors tend
                    to prepare prehealth professional more effectively. Prehealth professional programs tend
                    to prefer students who have shown that they have the potential to handle the rigorous
                    demands of their programs by having been exposed to a science-based curriculum. At
                    UCF we have a number of undergraduate programs that can serve to prepare a
                    preprofessional health student for the next step in his/her education. These programs
                    include: Biology, Chemistry, Molecular Biology &amp; Microbiology, Psychology, and
                    Interdisciplinary Studies.</p>
                    <p>
                    The Department of Biology has a Biology-Preprofessional concentration that is
                    well designed to assist a student in gaining admission to and succeeding in a professional
                    health program. The program has a number of core courses that will prepare a student for
                    the required standardized entrance examinations and will give the student a firm
                    foundation for the scientific requirements of the health professional program. These core
                    courses include: Biology 1 (BSC 2010), Biology 2 (BSC 2011), Chemistry 1 (CHM
                    2045), Chemistry 2 (CHM 2046), Organic Chemistry 1 (CHM 2210), Organic Chemistry
                    2 (CHM 2211), Genetics (PCB 3063), Physics 1 (PHY 2048 or PHY 2053), Physics 2
                    (PHY 2049 or PHY 2054), and Molecular Cell Biology (PCB 3023). In addition, the
                    Biology-Preprofessional concentration allows for studying in a number of upper division
                    restricted electives that are extremely beneficial to the serious prehealth professional
                    student. Upper division restricted electives such as: Biochemistry (BCH 4053), Genetics
                    2 (PCB 4514), Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy (ZOO 3713c), Embryology (ZOO
                    4603c), and General Microbiology (MCB 3020c); give the student an extensive
                    knowledge base to get him/her off to a very good start in any health professional
                    program.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the graduation requirements of the Biology-Preprofessional
                    concentration give the student a degree of academic flexibility. UCF requires a minimum
                    of 48 credit hours of 3,000 and above level courses for graduation. The basic
                    requirements of the Biology major require a minimum of 35 hours of 3,000 and above
                    level courses. That leaves a 13 credit hour discrepancy that a student can use in any way
                    that he/she feels will best prepare him/her to succeed in a health professional program. It
                    typically is most beneficial if the student works closely with his/her academic advisor to
                    choose these courses.</p>
                    <p>The Department of Biology has a number of faculty serving as academic advisors
                    who are well versed in the requirements of a health professional program and the
                    requirements for acceptance into such programs. These advisors have many years of
                    experience advising preprofessional health students and assisting them in reaching their
                    goals.</p>
                    <p>The Department of Biology has a number of other resources that will also assist the
                    prehealth professional student to prepare for a professional health program and to
                    separate himself/herself from other applicants. These resources include: internships,
                    independent studies, and research opportunities. All of these resources demonstrate
                    scholarly interest and academic initiative of the nature favored by professional health
                    program admittance committees.</p>
                    <p>
                    The prehealth professional concentration of the Biology undergraduate program
                    possesses many resources and opportunities that will benefit the prehealth professional
                    student. The concentration in particular, and the degree program in general, will serve
                    the serious student well in achieving his/her goal of entering into, and succeeding in, a
                    professional health program.</p>

                         <h3>Preveterinary Shadowing Opportunity:</h3>
                        <p>
                        Arrangements have been made with University Animal Hospital (9357 University
                        Blvd, Orlando - (407) 657-7297) to allow UCF students to shadow with the veterinarians.
                        Any student who is interested should meet with Frank Logiudice (BL 301c). Shadowing
                        will occur in the mornings of mondays, thursdays, and fridays (when they typically
                        conduct surgeries). UAH only wants one student per day. That way we can accommodate
                        3 students per week. Students will be rotated through for 4 shadowing days (4 weeks). At
                        the end of the month 3 new students will be brought in. This way up to 12 students can
                        shadow per term (based on interest level). Thank you to UAH for giving our students
                        this wonderful opportunity!</p>
                        
                       
                        <h3>Prehealth Professional Organizations</h3>
                        <p>
                        There are a number of prehealth professional organizations on campus. These are
                        student clubs that are dedicated to helping student to prepare for, and to apply into, a
                        career in the health professions. They are a great way to learn what challenges await
                        you and to prepare for them. Club events include visits to health professional
                        programs, visits with faculty and students at professional schools, shadowing
                        opportunities, and charity events. You should explore these clubs. Typically the first
                        week in September is when they have their first meetings for the fall semester. Some
                        of the clubs are:</p>
